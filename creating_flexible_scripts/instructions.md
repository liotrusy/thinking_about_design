# How to test this script

I built this script using Python 3.9.

Here are the instructions to run this script on a Windows machine:

1. Install Python 3.9 (make sure it's available in the PATH environmental variable)
2. Download the 'AppleStore.csv' file
3. Download the 'any_genre_avg_rating.py' file
4. Download the 'genres.txt' file containing references and useful information about the genres in the dataset

## Execution

To calculate the average you must:
1. Invoke the interpreter
2. Pass the name of the script: ```any_genere_avg_rating.py```
3. Pass the names of the genres you want to explore. Remember, names that contain spaces must be placed between double quotes.

NOTES: You don't have to type or remember the genre names, you can simply pick and copy-paste the names from the genres.txt file.

Here is an example below.

```bash
> python any_genere_avg_rating.py "Social Networking" Games

```
